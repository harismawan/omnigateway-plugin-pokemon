/**
 * The loop as the gateway drives it: the plugin's own `setup`, its own
 * migrations, SQLite, and real events.
 *
 * Every other test in this package exercises one piece. This is the one that
 * would notice if the pieces stopped fitting — a credit that never reaches the
 * state machine, a graduation that never reaches the Dex, an event handler
 * subscribed to the wrong thing.
 *
 * The storage seam is `helpers/storage.ts` rather than the gateway's own store:
 * `@omni/store` is internal and unpublished, so nothing an external plugin can
 * install runs its SQL for it. Two cases that lived here in the monorepo were
 * dropped with the seam, because they asserted the *host's* behaviour and not
 * this companion's, and are covered in the monorepo against the real store
 * instead of being reimplemented here:
 *
 * - that the host records a plugin's migrations and reports the failed one
 *   (`migrate(...).failed`);
 * - that the loader mounts what `setup` returns.
 *
 * What remains is what a third-party author can actually verify: that this
 * plugin's own migrations, routes and handlers do what they claim.
