/**
 * The plugin's only outbound dependency, and the only part of the game that can

 *
 * Two rules shape everything below, and both come from the spec rather than
 * from convenience:
 *
 * **Cache first, always.** The sprite for #25 does not change and neither does
 * its capture rate, so an asset is fetched once and kept. A cached asset is
 * never refetched, which is also what makes a busy install polite to a free
 * public API it does not pay for.
 *
 * **A miss is normal, never an error.** `data/` is excluded from database
 * snapshots, so after a restore *every* cached file is gone, and an air-gapped
 * install never had any. Every function here returns `null` (or an empty index)
 * on failure instead of throwing: the caller renders an unhatched egg and says
 * species data could not be fetched. This module is reached from a request
 * path, and a cosmetic feature must not be able to take one down.
 *
 * Capabilities arrive as arguments. Nothing here reaches for `fetch`, `process`,
 * or a filesystem module, so a test supplies a stub pair and no test can touch
 * the network or a real directory by accident.
