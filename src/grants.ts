/**
 * Decides what a limit event is worth.
 *
 * **Rate-limited by the window's own length, not edge-triggered on a level.**
 * That is a correction, and the reasoning is worth keeping because the obvious
 * design does not work.
 *
 * The obvious design records that a window has been paid and waits for it to
 * empty before paying again. There is no event for emptying. `LimitReached`
 * fires while a key is at its ceiling and says nothing when it drops, so
 * "already paid" is a latch that never re-arms: the window pays once and then
 * never again for the life of the installation. An integration test caught
 * exactly that, after the unit tests for this file passed.
 *
 * A window cannot legitimately fill more than once per its own duration, so the
 * duration is the rate limit. A `1w` ceiling pays at most weekly, a `1m` ceiling
 * at most once a minute, and a key parked at its limit collects on the same
 * schedule it would have earned anyway.
 *
 * Seeding still applies: the first sighting of a key records the instant and
 * pays nothing, so installing against a key already at its ceiling is not a
 * backdated windfall.
